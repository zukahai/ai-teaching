```
"Học sinh X có thái độ học tập tốt. Em cần cố gắng hơn ở môn Toán. Phụ huynh cần quan tâm hơn đến việc học của con."

[Generic, minimal insight, took 15 minutes to write]
```

**After AI optimization:**
```
"Trong học kỳ này, em X đã thể hiện thái độ học tập tích cực với 95% bài tập được hoàn thành đúng hạn. Điểm mạnh của em là khả năng tư duy logic tốt, đặc biệt trong các bài toán hình học. 

Tuy nhiên, em còn gặp khó khăn với đại số, cụ thể là giải phương trình bậc hai (điểm trung bình 6.2/10). Để cải thiện, em cần:
1. Luyện tập thêm 15 phút/ngày với các dạng bài cơ bản
2. Tham gia nhóm học tập với bạn giỏi vào thứ 7
3. Sử dụng app Khan Academy để học bổ sung

Phụ huynh có thể hỗ trợ bằng cách kiểm tra bài tập hàng ngày và động viên con khi gặp khó khăn. Em dự kiến sẽ cải thiện lên 7.5/10 vào cuối học kỳ II nếu thực hiện đều đặn các gợi ý trên."
